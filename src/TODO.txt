TODO:

make AI take shots if it makes a hit maybe use an array of all posible shots then get it to shot up down left right 
could use a bool if bool = 1 save cord and then randomly go up down left right

Add win and end messages  etc - tidy up

maybe try make a game class

fix build system make it run on mutiple systems

On inputs change boat placement to take all three at once,
    - clear inputs before taking more inputs
